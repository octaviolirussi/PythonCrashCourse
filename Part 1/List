A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that
includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of
all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and
the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because
a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the
name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names.

In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements
in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that
contains a few kinds of bicycles:

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index Positions:

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[1])
print(bicycles[3])

cannondale
specialized

Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By ask-
ing for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list:

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[-1])
specialized

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}."
print(message)
My first bicycle was a Trek.

Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements:

Modifying Elements in a List:

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)

Adding Elements to a List: append

motorcycles.append('ducati')
print(motorcycles)
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']

Removing Elements from a List: del

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
del motorcycles[0]
print(motorcycles)

pop() --> removes the LAST item in a list, but it lets you work
with that item after removing it. Like a stack

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
print(motorcycles)
print(popped_motorcycle)

['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha']
suzuki

You can use pop() to remove an item from any position in a list by including
the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses.

first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
print(f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")

Removing an Item by Value:

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
print(motorcycles)
motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print(motorcycles)

['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

Organizing a List:

Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method:

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
 cars.sort()
print(cars)
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota'] --> The cars are now in alphabetical order

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort(reverse=True)
print(cars)
['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi'] --> You can also sort this list in reverse alphabetical order by passing the
argument reverse=True to the sort() method.


Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function:

The sorted() function lets you display your list
in a particular order but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list.

print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)
print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))
print("\nHere is the original list again:")
print(cars)     

Here is the original list:
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
Here is the sorted list:
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
Here is the original list again:
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']


Printing a List in Reverse Order:

The reverse() method changes the order of a list permanently, but you
can revert to the original order anytime by applying reverse() to the same
list a second time.

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print(cars)
cars.reverse()
print(cars)

['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']

Notice that reverse() doesn’t sort backward alphabetically; it simply
reverses the order of the list:


Finding the Length of a List:

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
len(cars)
4
